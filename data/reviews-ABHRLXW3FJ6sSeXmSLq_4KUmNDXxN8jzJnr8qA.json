    "comment": "Incredible experience at Cocoon Canggu! I had the Colontherapy, IV fusion and full body LED light treatment. My nurse was Nurse Dita,  she conducted the Colontherapy and IV treatment. She was gentle and informative, and highly experienced. Everything was sterile and they showed all medications in date. During the IV fusion, the lovely Tini did a quick face wash and Gold Colagen mask, plus an amazing foot massage - I’ve had IV treatments at other salons and this wasn’t included (and for the same price). The LED light is no joke - it’s massive and covers the entire body. It’s industrial strength and definitely worth the price point. Shout out to Weby at the front desk who made the booking  and after-care instructions super easy. Highly recommend.",
